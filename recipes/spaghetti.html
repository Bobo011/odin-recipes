        When it comes to Italian comfort food, a bowl of spaghetti tossed with a
        tomato-rich meat sauce ranks high. If I’ve got the time, I love spending
        the afternoon slowly simmering a Bolognese sauce. More often than not,
        though, a packed schedule means dinner needs to be a much faster affair.
        This quick and easy spaghetti sauce is a total weeknight win. It’s as
        satisfying as a slow-simmered pasta sauce but comes together in less
        than 45 minutes — including the time it takes to boil a box of
        spaghetti.
